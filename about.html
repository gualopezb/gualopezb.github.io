  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I am a software engineer passionate about new technologies and well structured code. I have 3+ years of experience in software development. Over the last two years, I have strengthened my skills as a back-end developer, using multiple programming languages both object-oriented and functional paradigms, some of which are: Ruby, Javascript, PHP, Java, Elixir, and so on. I have a good understanding about creating database schemas that represent and support business processes and code versioning tools such as Git.
  </p>

  <p>On the other hand, I have also experience as a front-end developer, gaining experience in integrating web services and REST APIs. I have a proficient understanding of web technologies, including HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript; basic skills for CSS pre-processing tools, such as LESS and SASS; good knowledge of JavaScript frameworks and libraries, including React, AngularJS and jQuery, along with asynchronous request handling and AJAX.
  </p>
