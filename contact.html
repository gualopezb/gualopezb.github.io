  I am a software engineer passionate about new technologies and well structured code. I have 3+ years of experience in software development.
  Over the last two years, I have strengthened my skills as a back-end developer, using multiple programming languages both object-oriented and functional paradigms among which are: Ruby, Javascript, PHP, Java, Elixir, and so on. I have a good understanding about creating database schemas that represent and support business processes and code versioning tools such as Git.
